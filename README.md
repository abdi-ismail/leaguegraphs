This repository contains a web scraping script that visualizes football league table points across matchweeks. I created this project because I struggled to find online charts that tracked Premier League points earned over time, so I decided to build one myself. Itâ€™s been a great opportunity to refresh my Python skills and explore new libraries. 

The project is still a work in progress and I plan to add features like saving points data into a CSV file.
